## EAK Todos, Updated for Ember-CLI

I converted the [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) sample app, [EAK Todos](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit-todos), to work with the new hotness that is [Ember CLI](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli).

Fairly simple process.  Importing directly into a test doesn't work in ember-cli right now, so I'm just resolving dependencies.  Everything else worked more or less out of the box.

Built to better understand the differences between EAK and Ember-CLI.
